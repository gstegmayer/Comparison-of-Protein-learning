## Intro

Representation learning techniques are being used for encoding different types
of protein information (sequence, domains, interactions, etc.) as
low-dimensional vectors. In this study, we performed a detailed comparison of
several protein sequence embeddings on several bioinformatics tasks:

* determining similarities between proteins in the embeddings projected space.

* inferring protein domains.

* predicting ontology-based protein functions.


## Notebook

This [notebook]() reproduces the result showing the capability of protein
sequence embeddings for capturing protein domain information.
