# Comparison of protein sequence embeddings

This repository contains the data and code for reproducing results shown in
the study entitled *"Transfer learning in proteomics: comparison of novel
learned representations for protein sequences,"* by E. Fenoy, A. Edera and
G. Stegmayer (under review). Research Institute for Signals, Systems and
Computational Intelligence, [sinc(i)](https://sinc.unl.edu.ar).


## Intro

Representation learning techniques are being used for encoding different types
of protein information (sequence, domains, interactions, etc.) as
low-dimensional vectors. In this study, we performed a detailed comparison of
several protein sequence embeddings on several bioinformatics tasks: (i)
determining similarities between proteins in the embeddings projected space;
(ii) inferring protein domains; and (iii) predicting ontology-based protein
functions.

## Notebook

This [notebook]() reproduces the 2-D projections estimated from the embeddings
built by different methods, showing how these representation are able to
capture protein domain information.
